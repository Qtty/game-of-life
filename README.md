in each game mode you must select an initial state,for wolfram it's usually the middle cell in the first row,
as for conway,thre are a lot of interesting initial states.

in conway there is a set of helpful keys:
* RETURN : begins of pauses the game

* l(load) : loads an already existing form to a pos(forms are saved in forms file)

* s(save) : starts saving a form skeleton,save the form by pressing s again 

* r(reset) : resets the game to it's intial state
